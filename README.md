# Testing
We employed two testing tools to ensure the error-free nature of our code. we utilized validator testing tools, such as:
1. Nu Html Checker (w3.org): identifies potential issues affecting webpage functionality.
2. W3C CSS Validator for TextArea (CSS level 3 + SVG): identifies and highlighting errors or warnings that may impact the styling of our web pages.

During the validation process, errors were detected, signifying areas for improvement. Recognizing and addressing these syntax errors is crucial for ongoing development, ensuring our code remains free of potential issues. Moving forward, we are committed to addressing identified problems and to uphold code quality.
